Welcome to our pizzaria! We are going to create a whole bunch of code today to practice object oriented programming. Object oriented programming is the practice of dividing your code into parts that mimic objects in the real world.

To create a pizzaria we start with a classical exercise to name all the parts in a pizzaria. We should end up with a list similar to this:

Pizzaria
> Guests
> Waiter
> Cook
> Recipes
> Menu
> Ingredients
> Amount of ingredients
> Storageroom

Guests can order a dish with the waiter. If the ingredients are available, it is cooked. When we cook it, the ingredients are removed from the storageroom and combined into a lovely dish by the cook. When they are done eating and drinking, they can get the bill and make a payment.

This will all be done with a nice interactive menu. The waiter will be the menu.
